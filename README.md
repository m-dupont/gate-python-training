# gate-python-training

This repo was used for the GATE python training in 2020 at Clermont Ferrand. 

In order to execute code, you need GATE with numpy output. 

It contains two Jupyter notebooks : 
* [Numpy vs ROOT vs texts outputs from game](gate_outputs/gate_outputs.ipynb).
* [How to reproduce ROOT analyse in python, but not with pyROOT](<from_gate_training/exercise_session14_radioprotection/Reproduce Root analyse.ipynb>)
* [How to open data from a PET simulation](open_data/open_data.ipynb ). It illustrates how to open numpy output, exercices consist to reproduces singles file from the hits file.
* [How to launch GATE in parallel from python](parallelisation/parallelisation.ipynb)
